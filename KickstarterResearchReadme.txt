Kickstarter Research - 2019
----------------------------
  Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively 
successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project
has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter,
only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the 
project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through 
past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. 

In this project I organized and analyzed a database of four thousand 
past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

----------------------------

- Filled each cell in the "state" column with a different color, depending on 
whether the associated campaign was "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or "live".

- Created and formatted a new column, "percent funded", to calculate how much money
a campaign made toward Its initial goal. Red = 0%, Green = 100%, Blue=200%. 

- Created an "average donation" column that calculates how much each backer paid 
on average.

- Created a "catagory" and "sub-catagory" column to break up the "Catagory and 
Sub-Catagory" into two parts.

- Created a new sheet with pivot table to analyze data to count how many campaigns
were "sucessful," "failed,"  "cancelled," or were "live" per catagory and per sub-catagory.

- Converted unix timestamps to a readable format

- Created a new sheet with pivot table to visualize campaign start dates vs. success.

- Created a new sheet with graph to show Outcomes Based on Goal Amount.
